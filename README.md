# PassifloraLeaves
Data and code used to produce figures for the morphometric analysis of Passiflora leaves

####Description
This repository contains the data and code used to produce figures for two manuscripts currently in preparation by Dan Chitwood (Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, St. Louis, MO, USA) and Wagner Otoni (Universidade Federal de Viçosa, Viçosa, Estado de Minas Gerais, Brazil). Over 3,000 leaves from 40 Passiflora species were morphometrically analyzed using:

1. Landmarks of the vasculature
2. Elliptical Fourier descriptors of the blade

There will be two papers. The tentative titles are:

**Paper 1:** Morphometric analysis of Passiflora leaves I: the relationship between landmarks of the vasculature and elliptical Fourier descriptors of the blade

**Paper 2:** Morphometric analysis of Passiflora leaves II: divergent heteroblastic trajectories underlie the disparate leaf shapes among Passiflora species
